# RgxReplaceIO
RgxReplaceIO is an IO library which provides you with streams able to replace the content,
that matches a specific regex, while being read/written.  
The library comprises 2 byte streams and 2 character streams (input/output)

## Usage
```Java
Reader underlyingStream = ...
ReplaceReader reader = new ReplaceReader(underlyingStream, "regex to be matched", "replacement");
```
You can also specify buffer size, instead of using the default one:
```Java
int bufferSize = 1024;
ReplaceReader reader = new ReplaceReader(underlyingStream, "regex to be matched", "replacement", bufferSize);
```
Then use it as a normal stream while replacements automatically take place underneath.

### Warning
Those streams are not thread-safe at all! Do not read any stream from more than one thread.

## TODO
+ implement a regex engine to overcome limitations given by java.util.regex.Matcher
